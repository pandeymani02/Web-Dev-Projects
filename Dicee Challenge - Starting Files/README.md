The Simple Dice Change project is a web application that simulates rolling dice. 
It allows users to change the displayed dice image randomly with a click of a button. 
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:

Dice Images: The project displays dice images using HTML <img> tags. 
Each dice face is represented by a separate image file (e.g., dice1.png, dice2.png, etc.), and the images are styled using CSS.

Random Dice Change: By clicking a button or triggering an event, the JavaScript code generates a random number between 1 and 6. 
Based on this random number, the corresponding dice image is selected and displayed on the webpage.

Responsive Design: The project incorporates responsive design techniques using CSS media queries,
ensuring that the dice images and overall layout adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

User Interaction: The project encourages user interaction by allowing users to roll the dice and observe the outcome. 
Each time the dice image changes, users get a sense of randomness and enjoy the experience of a virtual dice roll.

Overall, the Simple Dice Change project provides a fun and interactive way to simulate rolling dice using web technologies.
It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic content and engage users in an enjoyable dice-rolling experience.

Note: The above description assumes a basic functionality where the dice image changes randomly with a click. 
If your project includes additional features or functionalities, please provide more details so that I can enhance the description accordingly.
